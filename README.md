# williamsbdev.com blog

[![Build Status][]](https://travis-ci.org/williamsbdev/williamsbdev.github.io)

In order to run the blog locally you will need to have ruby on your machine and
run the following command:

    gem install jekyll

If changes are made to the styling or JavaScript, run the following:

    npm install
    make changes
    grunt deploy

Once this has finished installing all the dependencies, run the following
command to spin up the site locally at localhost:4000:

    jekyll serve

Please visit [jekyll] for more information about
how it works.

Credit for all the design work goes to [Jarrod C Taylor]. I took the design he was
using for his [blog].
