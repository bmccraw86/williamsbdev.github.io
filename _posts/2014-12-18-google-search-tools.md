There are some things that I just take for granted now when doing a
[Google](http://google.com) search. I use Chrome as my default browser so these
may be specific to Chrome and I make no guarantees of these working in other
browsers or search engines. Let's start with some tricks to avoid using the mouse.

##### Open a new tab.

  `<ctrl> + t (PC)`

  `<cmd> + t (Mac)`

##### Get back to the URL bar

  `<ctrl> + l (PC)`

  `<cmd> + l (Mac)`

##### Cycle through search results (works for PC and Mac)

  `<tab> (get to the first search result)`

  `down/up arrow keys (cycle through results)`

  `<enter/return> (select result)`

##### Return to search results from selected result

  `<backspace> (PC)`

  `<delete> (Mac)`

##### Close a tab

  `<ctrl> + w (PC)`

  `<cmd> + w (Mac)`

##### Open most recently closed tab (will continue opening previously closed tab)

  `<ctrl> + T (PC)`

  `<cmd> + T (Mac)`

One more tick that I actually just learned today was the search tools within
Chrome. After searching, you have the ability to click the "Search tools"
button. This will give you the options to results based on results within the
past hour, 24 hours, week, month, year or custom range. There is also another
option to search based on visited links, not yet visited, reading level, or
verbatim. You can also search by location. I have only used the time range so
far but look forward to using the other options in my future searches.
